<!-- ## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### Continued development

I would love to continue working on CSS. As I build more projects mobile first I notice that I'm getting more comfortable with it. Before I was afraid of media queries but now i use them often. I also want to work more with grid. I've worked quite a bit with flexbox and feel comfortable with that but this was my first project using CSS grid. I would also like to try using styled componets and a CSS preprocessor.


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/pr_grid.asp)
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout)
- Both of the above resources have helped me with grid. i usually find success using two resources fora single topic. Both of these sites are great resources I recommend for beginners. -->
